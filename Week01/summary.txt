Data Science isn’t simple to describe it encompasses multiple fields such as data collection, statistics, data management, data visualization, and data analysis, etc. So when we speak about data science we are dealing with numerous field of study which combines together to solve a business problem or a project. Data Science is basically dealing with the data that may be in large or small amounts, starting from the data extraction to data refinement or data cleansing, scientific researches, finding insightful patterns within data, arranging the data, using the knowledge(pattern within data), using various statistical methods to arrange or classify the data, using different algorithms to make use of pattern and using tools and techniques for creating data modules which can learn and improve itself without being explicitly programmed this all comes under the part of data science. So when we speak about data science it isn’t about a particular field it is rather a multitude of fields combined together to solve a query or business problem. For a long time, it has been a controversy that statisticians are the data scientist but when we look at the other fields such as data extracting, which involves a broad range of domains and research to find out useful data, and other fields such as data modeling where the program is visualized or the connections within the data are arranged these all plays a major role so only statistics cannot be considered as the sole reason for Data Science. Rather Data science itself has numerous fields such as statistician or data analyst or data scientist, this makes it clear that Data science can be categorized into numerous fields and every field plays a crucial role. Data Science also deals with a good amount of research and exploring the data to examine the requirements of the particular project and make sure that the data is appropriate for the desired work. Moreover, Data Science also deals with Machine Learning which is basically part of Artificial intelligence, basically, Machine learning is implementing or designing an application using modern techniques, tools, and algorithms that allow the application to learn by itself and improve its performance over time.  Although there is an argument that Data science is not a new field but rather a new name for statistics I myself believe that it is more than statistics as quantitative analysis is just a part of Data Science.
